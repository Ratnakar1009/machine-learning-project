A movie recommendation system using machine learning suggests movies to users based on their preferences and behavior.
It starts with data collection, gathering user interactions and movie information. Data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering, ensures the data is ready for analysis. Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based) and content-based filtering models are built to understand user preferences and movie similarities
. Hybrid models combine both approaches for better accuracy. The system is trained and evaluated using metrics like RMSE. 
Personalization techniques rank and diversify recommendations. Finally, the system is deployed via APIs, integrated with user interfaces, and continuously monitored to improve recommendations based on user feedback, while ensuring fairness and transparency.
